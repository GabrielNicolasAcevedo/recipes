    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Have you ever tried empanadas? They're a typical food here in Argentina.</p>
    <p>Once you've tried one, you will want more!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g ground meat</li>
        <li>500g onion</li>
        <li>24 empanada discs</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Condiments: Sweet paprika, cumin and chili</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First we are going to cut the onions into cubes and cook it in a pot over medium heat until they become transparent.</li>
        <li>When onions are transparent, put max heat and add all the meat. Stir the meat so it doesn't stick.  </li>
        <li>When the meat is sealed, lower the heat, add the condiments and cover (not completely, leaving a small gap) and let cook for half an hour, stirring occasionally. (I add half liter of broth for juicy empanadas)</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let cool in the pot. In this step, you can boil eggs to add to the filling or anything you want such as olives, or boiled potato. </li>
        <li>Divide the filling into each empanada disc and seal with the traditional "repulgue".</li>
        <li>Place the empanadas in a baking sheet, paint them with egg and bake in hot oven (max) until golden brown. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
